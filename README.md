# wish-bridge

Project Description:
"WishBridge" offers a safe platform where underprivileged children can express their wishes and well-intentioned people can grant them. Users have two choices: they can either make a wish or grant a wish.

Make a Wish:
Underprivileged children, with the help of a parent or guardian, can make a wish by clicking the "Make a Wish" button. They will then fill out a secure form where they describe their wish and provide the delivery address for the items. For privacy and security, all personal information related to the child is stored securely by a trusted third-party database and is not shared with wish grantors.

Grant a Wish:
Compassionate individuals can grant a wish by selecting one displayed on the site. They will then click the "Grant a Wish" button and provide identification to verify their credibility and ensure the safety of the children. Upon verification, they will receive the address of the third-party organization, where they can send the donation (the wished-for item). The third-party organization will then deliver the item to the child, fulfilling their wish.

Key Features:
Two options: Make a Wish or Grant a Wish, fostering a sense of community and empathy.
Secure and private wish-making process for underprivileged children, protecting their personal information.
Verification process for wish grantors to ensure the safety and well-being of the children.
Collaboration with a trusted third-party organization for the safe delivery of donated items.
A platform dedicated to spreading kindness, compassion, and hope to those in need.
